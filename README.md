## Meaning of SandHope

The inspiration for SandHope comes from nature. In the natural world, each grain of sand may be small, but when they come together, they can form magnificent sand dunes, and new life can emerge on these dunes. This is the vision of the open-source community—each participant is like a grain of sand, seemingly insignificant, but when everyone works together and puts in a collective effort, they can nurture abundant achievements.

### Logo Explanation

- **Grain of Sand**: Represents each participant. No matter the size of the contribution, every individual is an essential part.
- **Sand Dune**: Symbolizes the organization formed by numerous participants.
- **Decaying Wood**: The black parts on the sand dune represent decaying wood in nature, which, although no longer growing, provides nourishment for new life. In the open-source community, this symbolizes inactive or archived repositories that provide valuable resources and experience for new projects, helping newcomers learn and grow.
